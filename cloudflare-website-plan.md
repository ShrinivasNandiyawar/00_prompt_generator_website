# Cloudflare Website Deployment Plan

This document outlines the steps to create and deploy a website using Cloudflare Pages and GitHub.

## Steps

1.  **Create a basic website:** Create a simple "Hello, World!" website with an `index.html` file in a new directory.

2.  **Initialize a Git repository:** Initialize a local Git repository in the project directory using the `git init` command.

3.  **Create a GitHub repository:** Create a new, empty repository on GitHub. *Important: Do not add a README or .gitignore during the initial creation.* You can do this by going to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).

4.  **Connect local and remote repositories:** Connect your local Git repository to the remote GitHub repository using the `git remote add origin [repository URL]` command. The repository URL can be found on the GitHub repository page.

5.  **Push the initial commit:** Commit the initial website files and push them to the GitHub repository using the following commands:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main
    ```

6.  **Set up Cloudflare Pages:**
    *   Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard.
    *   Select "Pages" from the sidebar.
    *   Click "Create a project".
    *   Connect to your GitHub account.
    *   Select the newly created repository from the list.
    *   Configure build settings:
        *   **Project Name:** Choose a name for your project (this will be part of your Cloudflare Pages URL).
        *   **Production branch:** `main` (or `master` if you used that).
        *   **Framework preset:** None (for a basic HTML site). If you later decide to use a framework, you can select it here.
        *   **Build command:** (Leave blank for a basic HTML site).
        *   **Build output directory:** (Leave blank for a basic HTML site, or set to the appropriate directory if using a framework, e.g., `public` or `dist`).
    *   Click "Save and Deploy".

7.  **Connect Custom Domain:**
    *   Go to the Cloudflare DNS settings for your domain.
    *   Add a CNAME record:
        *   **Name:** Your domain name (or a subdomain, like `www`).
        *   **Target:** Your Cloudflare Pages default URL, which will be something like `[project-name].pages.dev`. You can find this on the Cloudflare Pages project page.
        *   **Proxy status:** Proxied (the orange cloud icon).
